				<h2> About Me </h2>
				<p> Hi, my name is Salmaan Saeed. I am majoring in Information Technology. 
				I expect to graduate in December 2023. My interests in technology includes web programming, 
				operating systems, small programming, and scriting. During my free time, I like to play video games. </p>
				
				<h2> Documentation </h2>
				<p> I learned that documentation is my best friend. When I had problem with pushing the docker container to Azure. 
				I read the documentation on "Deploying Docker containers on Azure". It helped me to deploy the docker container to 
				Azure. </p>
				<p> Another scenario was when I had to figure out how to install Nvidia drivers on Debian. I read the Nvidia 
				Proprietary Driver page on Debian's website. I helped me with the installation of Nvidia drivers on Debian. </p> 
				
				<h2> Resume </h2>
				<p> I have a link to my <a href="Resume.pdf">resume</a> that you can take a look at. </p>
