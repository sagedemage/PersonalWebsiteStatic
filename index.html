			<h2> About Me </h2>
			<p> Hi, my name is Salmaan. I am interesting in technology in general. Specific things that interests me are scripting/basic programming, operating systems and gaming interests me. </p>
			<p> The Desktop I use is an 4th gen intel computer. I had doen some major upgrades to the computer. I added a GTX 1060 6GB to that machine. I replaces the wifi with a network card that suports 2GHz and 5GHz. I had that computer for 8 years as of October 2021. </p>
			<p> I dual boot Windows and Linux on my older desktop. Windows 11 is not even compatible with that machine lol. Oh well, I guess I will still use Windows 10 until it loses support. I would have to use Linux on that machine anyways just to give it some more life without contributing to the ewaste. Of course Windows 11 is going to contribute to ewaste sadly :(. </p>
