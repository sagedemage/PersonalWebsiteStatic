					<h2> Operating Systems </h2>
					<p> I dual boot between Windows and Linux on my desktop. I use two different storage drives to dual boot between the operating systems. 
					The Grub bootloader allows me to do this. I was thinking about trying BSD operating systems on virtual machine. 
					I have been doing some research on OpenBSD. You can kind of see that I have a bias for Unix like systems. 
					Using Linux made me like how Unix and Unix like operating systems work. </p>
				
					<h3> The Linux Distro I Use </h3>
					<div class="caption">

						<p> The Linux distro I use on my system is Debian. Debian is a stable linux distribution. Debian is the linux distribution that Ubuntu is based on. 
						Debian is easy to maintain since it does not receive updates as often. Debian get tested throughly to remove the software bugs before 
						a new release. </p> 
						<p> Debian has three branches you can choose from and these are stable, testing and unstable; Debian defaults to stable. Debian is a great distribution 
						for servers. For Desktop users, you are most likely to use the non-free iso not the default debian iso. The non-free iso comes with all the properitary 
						drivers needed to get your system running. This is important because without the non-free components, you computer will not be able to connect to the internet
						during the installation process. </p>

					<h3> What desktop environment I use on Linux </h3>
					<div class="caption">
						<img class="gnome_logo"src="images/gnome_logo.png" alt="Debain Logo">
						<p> I have used many desktop environments and windows managers. The desktop environments I tried out were KDE Plasma, Gnome, Xfce, LXQt, MATE,
						and Cinnamon. The Window Managers I have tried out were i3wm, Xmonad, Qtile, Awesomewm, Bspwm, DWM, Spectrwm, Openbox and FLuxbox. I has taken 
						me a few months on which DE or WM I liked the best. It definetly has been a long journey for me. </p>
						<p>The DE environment I use on Debian is Gnome. The reason I use Gnome because it is more responsive compared to the Cinnamon desktop and KDE Plasma. 
						When I was in Linux Mint, I had issues with the Cinnamon desktop being slower start up from a cold boot. For some reason, my keybaord shortcuts
						not response right away when starting Cinnamon desktop. I did not have those issues on Gnome. Gnome's ui is faster than KDE Plasma's UI. In general,
						Gnome is very well optimized. </p>
