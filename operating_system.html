				<h2> Operating Systems </h2>
				<p> I dual boot between Windows and Linux on my desktop. I use two different storage drives to dual boot between the operating systems. 
				The Grub bootloader allows me to do this. I was thinking about trying FreeBSD on virtual machine. 
				I have been doing some research on FreeBSD. You can kind of see that I have a bias for Unix like systems. 
				Using Linux made me like how Unix and Unix like operating systems work. </p>
				
				<h4> The Linux Distro I Use </h4>
				<p> The Linux distro I use on my system is Debian. Debian is a stable linux distribution. Debian is easy to maintain. 
				I used to use Arch Linux. Arch Linux is a rolling release distribution. Many foundamental software in like the grub 
				bootloader in Arch is buggy. Arch Linux is tedious to maintain. </p>
