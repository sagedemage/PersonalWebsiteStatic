					<h2> Operating Systems </h2>
					<p> I dual boot between Windows and Linux on my desktop. I use two different storage drives to dual boot between the operating systems. 
					The Grub bootloader allows me to do this. I was thinking about trying FreeBSD on virtual machine. 
					I have been doing some research on FreeBSD. You can kind of see that I have a bias for Unix like systems. 
					Using Linux made me like how Unix and Unix like operating systems work. </p>
				
					<h4> The Linux Distro I Use </h4>
					<p> The Linux distro I use on my system is Debian. Debian is a stable linux distribution. Debian is easy to maintain. 
					I used to use Arch Linux. Arch Linux is a rolling release distribution. Many foundamental software in like the grub 
					bootloader in Arch is buggy. Arch Linux is tedious to maintain. </p>

					<h4> What desktop environment I use on Linux </h4>
					<p> I have used many desktop environments and windows managers. The desktop environments I tried out were KDE Plasma, Gnome, Xfce, LXQt, MATE,
					and Cinnamon. The Window Managers I have tried out were i3wm, Xmonad, Qtile, Awesomewm, Bspwm, DWM, Spectrwm, Openbox and FLuxbox. I has taken 
					me a few months on which DE or WM I liked the best. It definetly has been a long journey for me. </p>
					<p>The DE environment I use on Debian is Gnome. The reason I use Gnome because it is more responsive compared to the Cinnamon desktop and KDE Plasma. 
					When I was in Linux Mint, I had issues with the Cinnamon desktop being slower start up from a cold boot. For some reason, my keybaord shortcuts
					not response right away when starting Cinnamon desktop. I did not have those issues on Gnome. Gnome's ui is faster than KDE Plasma's UI. In general,
					Gnome is very well optimized. </p>
